# NYC Taxi Revenue Optimization Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes NYC yellow taxi trip data to understand the relationship between payment methods and revenue generation. The analysis provides insights for optimizing driver revenue through payment method strategies.

## Key Findings

### ðŸ“Š Payment Method Analysis
- **74.3%** of trips use credit cards vs. **24.9%** using cash
- Credit card payments generate **significantly higher fares** on average
- Statistical testing confirms significant difference between payment types (p < 0.001)

### ðŸ’° Revenue Insights
- Average fare difference between card and cash payments: **$X.XX**
- Percentage revenue increase with card payments: **XX.X%**
- Trip distance and duration show strong correlation with fare amount

### ðŸš• Passenger Patterns
- **71.9%** of trips are single passengers
- Most common trip distance: **1.6 miles** (median)
- Average trip duration: **15.9 minutes**

## Technical Implementation

### Data Processing
- Cleaned dataset of 6.4 million taxi trips
- Handled missing values and outliers using IQR method
